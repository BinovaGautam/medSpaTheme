/* =============================================================================
   TREATMENT CARD SEMANTIC COMPLIANT - MOVED TO CONSOLIDATED FILE
   ============================================================================= */

/*
 * ALL TREATMENT CARD STYLES HAVE BEEN MOVED TO treatments-consolidated.css
 *
 * This prevents duplicate CSS declarations and ensures single source of truth.
 * The consolidated file is 100% semantic token compliant and contains all
 * treatment-related styles with proper semantic token usage.
 *
 * To modify treatment card styles, edit: assets/css/treatments-consolidated.css
 *
 * This file is kept for reference and to prevent 404 errors if the CSS is
 * still being loaded elsewhere in the theme.
