/* =============================================================================
   TREATMENT CARD COMPONENT - MOVED TO CONSOLIDATED FILE
   ============================================================================= */

/*
 * ALL TREATMENT CARD STYLES HAVE BEEN MOVED TO treatments-consolidated.css
 *
 * This prevents duplicate CSS declarations and ensures single source of truth.
 * The consolidated file contains all treatment-related styles including:
 * - .treatment-card base styles
 * - .treatment-card hover states
 * - .treatment-card variants (.comparing, etc.)
 * - All treatment-related components (image, content, actions, etc.)
 * - Responsive design rules
 *
 * To modify treatment card styles, edit: assets/css/treatments-consolidated.css
 *
 * This file is kept for reference and to prevent 404 errors if the CSS is
 * still being loaded elsewhere in the theme.
