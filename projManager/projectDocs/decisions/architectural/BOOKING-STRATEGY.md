## 🎯 **Decision Summary**

**The medical spa theme will NOT include custom booking form development.** All appointment scheduling, consultation booking, and patient intake forms will be handled by third-party plugins. The theme will provide comprehensive styling support and integration hooks for popular booking solutions.

Medical spa booking systems require:
- Complex appointment scheduling logic
- Payment processing integration
- Calendar synchronization
- Staff availability management
- Patient data management
- HIPAA compliance considerations
- Email/SMS notifications
- Recurring appointment handling

Building a custom booking system would:
- Significantly increase development time and complexity
- Require ongoing maintenance and updates
- Need payment gateway integrations
- Require compliance certifications
- Limit flexibility for different business models
