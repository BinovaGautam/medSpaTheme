## 🚨 **ESCALATION MATRIX & THRESHOLDS**

### **AI Confidence-Based Escalation**
```
ESCALATION TRIGGERS:

🟢 HIGH CONFIDENCE (90-100%) - AUTONOMOUS OPERATION
├── Action: AI proceeds independently
├── Human Notification: None required
├── Documentation: Auto-logged in decision audit trail
├── Review: Post-completion audit within 48 hours
└── Override: Human can stop/review at any time

🟡 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-89%) - SUPERVISED OPERATION  
├── Action: AI proceeds with human notification
├── Human Notification: Real-time alert to supervisor
├── Documentation: Immediate logging with confidence score
├── Review: Human spot-check within 4 hours
└── Override: Human approval required for critical path items

🔴 LOW CONFIDENCE (50-69%) - APPROVAL REQUIRED
├── Action: AI blocks and requests human approval
├── Human Notification: Immediate escalation alert
├── Documentation: Full context and reasoning provided
├── Review: Human review and approval required before proceeding
└── Override: Human takes full control of decision

⛔ VERY LOW CONFIDENCE (<50%) - HUMAN TAKEOVER
├── Action: AI stops work immediately
├── Human Notification: Emergency alert with full context
