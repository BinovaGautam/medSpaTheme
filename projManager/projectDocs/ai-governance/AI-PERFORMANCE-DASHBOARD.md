## 📈 **AI CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION**

### **Confidence Thresholds & Actions**
```
AI CONFIDENCE LEVELS:

🟢 HIGH CONFIDENCE (90-100%)
Action: Full autonomy, proceed without human review
Escalation: None required
Validation: Post-completion audit only

🟡 MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (70-89%)
Action: Proceed with notification to human supervisor
Escalation: Human review within 4 hours if critical path
Validation: Human spot-check required

🔴 LOW CONFIDENCE (50-69%)
Action: Require human approval before proceeding
Escalation: Immediate human supervisor notification
Validation: Full human review and approval required

⛔ VERY LOW CONFIDENCE (<50%)
Action: Block AI action, escalate to human immediately
Escalation: Stop work, require human intervention
Validation: Human takes over decision completely
```

### **Current Calibration Status**
```
CALIBRATION ACCURACY: 0% (Baseline - Needs Training Data)

Last Calibration: Never
Training Data Points: 0
Accuracy Target: >90% correlation between confidence and outcome
Current Gap: Unknown (No baseline data)

RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:
1. Begin confidence tracking for all AI decisions
2. Collect 100+ decision outcomes for calibration
3. Adjust thresholds based on historical accuracy
4. Implement feedback loops for continuous improvement
