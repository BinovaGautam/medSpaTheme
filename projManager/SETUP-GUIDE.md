# StarterKit v2.0 - Setup Guide for AI Agents

## 🚀 Quick Initialization Protocol

### Step 1: Project Analysis (30 seconds)
```markdown
SCAN PROJECT ENVIRONMENT:
□ Check for package.json, requirements.txt, Cargo.toml (→ software-development)
□ Look for .sketch, .fig, design files (→ design-projects)  
□ Find _config.yml, content/ directory (→ content-creation)
□ Identify research papers, data files (→ research)
□ Default fallback (→ general)

DETERMINE PROJECT DOMAIN:
- Software Development: Web, mobile, desktop applications
- Design Projects: UX/UI, brand design, product design
- Content Creation: Documentation, marketing, publishing
- Research: Academic, business intelligence, data analysis
- Business Projects: Strategy, operations, management
```

### Step 2: Directory Structure Creation (60 seconds)
```bash
CREATE STRUCTURE FROM master-index.json:

### Step 3: Template Installation (90 seconds)
```markdown
INSTALL BASE TEMPLATES:

□ decisions/templates/decision-template.md  
□ tasks/templates/task-template.md
□ knowledge/templates/lesson-learned-template.md

PROJECT-SPECIFIC TEMPLATES:
Software Development:

Design Projects:
□ execution/templates/design-review-template.md  
□ execution/templates/user-research-template.md

Research Projects:
□ execution/templates/research-methodology-template.md
□ execution/templates/data-analysis-template.md
```

### Step 4: System Configuration (30 seconds)
```json
CREATE core/system-config.json:
{
  "project": {
    "name": "[Auto-detected or provided]",
    "type": "[Detected project type]", 
    "domain": "[Project domain]",
    "initialized": "[Timestamp]"
  },
  "routing": {
    "enabled": true,
    "confidence_thresholds": {
      "auto_route": 0.9,
      "suggest": 0.7,
      "manual": 0.5
    }
  },
  "quality_gates": {
    "enforce_decision_journey": true,
    "require_acceptance_criteria": true,
    "validate_stakeholders": true
  },
  "automation": {
    "task_progression": true,
    "knowledge_graph_updates": true,
    "health_monitoring": true

## 🧠 AI Agent Operating Procedures

### File Processing Workflow
```markdown
WHEN NEW FILE DETECTED:

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS (First 1000 characters)
   - Extract key terms and patterns
   - Look for YAML frontmatter
   - Identify document structure

2. CATEGORY SCORING
   requirements: filename + content patterns match
   decisions: "decision", "alternative", "rationale" keywords
   tasks: "implement", "create", "build", action-oriented
   knowledge: "pattern", "lesson", "guide", reference material
   execution: code files, prototypes, implementations
   analytics: metrics, reports, dashboards

3. CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT
   >90%: Auto-route with notification
   70-90%: Suggest destination, await confirmation  
   <70%: Request human guidance

4. SUBDIRECTORY ROUTING
   Analyze content for status indicators:
   - "initial", "draft" → initial/
   - "completed", "done" → completed/
   - "blocked", "waiting" → blocked/
   - "mistake", "failed" → mistakes/
```

### Quality Gate Enforcement
```markdown
REQUIREMENT DOCUMENTS:
□ Specific stakeholder identified (not "users")
□ Measurable acceptance criteria
□ Clear business value
□ Dependencies mapped
□ Success metrics defined

DECISION DOCUMENTS:
□ Problem statement exists
□ Multiple alternatives considered  
□ Evaluation criteria defined
□ Clear rationale provided
□ Implementation plan included
□ Success metrics established

TASK DOCUMENTS:  
□ Clear description and scope
□ Acceptance criteria defined
□ Dependencies identified
□ Effort estimated
□ Owner assigned
```

### Knowledge Graph Maintenance
```markdown
AUTOMATIC RELATIONSHIP DETECTION:

Direct References (95% confidence):
- "REQ-001" mentioned in task → task implements requirement
- "ADR-005" referenced in code → implementation follows decision
- "TASK-123" mentioned in lesson → lesson learned from task

Semantic Similarity (80% confidence):
- Similar technical terms and concepts
- Related business domains
- Comparable implementation approaches

Temporal Proximity (60% confidence):  
- Files created within same timeframe
- Sequential task dependencies
- Decision-to-implementation chains
```

## 🔄 Continuous Learning Protocol

### Pattern Recognition
```markdown
CAPTURE SUCCESSFUL PATTERNS:
- Which requirement formats lead to successful implementation?
- What decision-making approaches prevent rework?
- Which task breakdown strategies work best?
- What communication patterns avoid misunderstandings?

UPDATE SYSTEM KNOWLEDGE:
- Enhance templates with successful patterns
- Add validation rules for common mistakes
- Create project-specific checklists
- Generate custom automation rules
```

### Mistake Prevention Evolution
```markdown
LEARN FROM FAILURES:
- Analyze root causes of project issues
- Identify early warning indicators
- Create prevention mechanisms
- Update quality gates and validation

KNOWLEDGE SHARING:
- Document anti-patterns to avoid
- Create lessons learned repository
- Share insights across projects
- Build organizational memory
```
