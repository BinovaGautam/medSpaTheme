### Journey Completeness
- [ ] **Problem**: Clear problem statement and context
- [ ] **Options**: At least 2 alternatives considered
- [ ] **Evaluation**: Systematic analysis with criteria
- [ ] **Decision**: Clear choice with rationale
- [ ] **Planning**: Actionable implementation plan
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Success metrics and review schedule

### Quality Checks
- [ ] **Specificity**: All sections are concrete, not vague

- [ ] **Timeline**: All dates and deadlines specified
- [ ] **Risk**: Major risks identified and mitigated

### Common Mistakes Prevented
- ✅ Multiple alternatives considered (not just chosen option)
- ✅ Quantitative evaluation (not just opinion)
- ✅ Clear implementation plan (not just decision)
- ✅ Measurable success criteria (not subjective)
- ✅ Review schedule set (not one-time decision)
