# levenestv2: Agentic Workflow Platform (Discovery Phase)

## Problem Statement
Modern software development is complex, involving many phases from requirements analysis to planning, coding, validation, and deployment. Existing AI-powered tools often focus only on code generation or problem solving, leading to inconsistent, context-insensitive results and failing to address the full software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Objective
To design and build a local-first, IDE-integrated platform that enables:
- Automation and orchestration of the entire SDLC, from requirements to release
- Context-aware, agentic workflows for every critical step (not just codegen/problem solving)
- Reliable enforcement of project standards and best practices
- Composable, reusable workflows that can be shared and extended
- Fast, developer-friendly experience with minimal overhead

## Principle: Objective → Variables → Feedback Loop
1. **Objective:** Start with a clear, one-line statement of what you want to achieve.
2. **Variables:** Identify the unknowns or sub-problems (variables) that must be solved to achieve the objective. Each variable becomes a smaller, testable objective.
3. **Feedback Loop:** Test each variable in isolation, gather feedback, and iterate. Only integrate solutions that are validated. This loop ensures robust, reliable progress toward the main objective.

## Proposed Solution
- Use YAML-based workflow definitions for human-readability and composability
- Hybrid agent structure: prompt-first for LLMs, script-backed for validation/enforcement
- Modular agents and workflows, versioned and discoverable (npm-style registry in future)
- Pre/post hooks for validation, context gathering, and feedback
- Designed for seamless integration with IDEs (VS Code, Cursor, etc.)
- **Extensible to all SDLC phases:** Requirements analysis, planning, codegen, review, testing, deployment, and more

## Core Concept
A platform where:
- Developers can define, compose, and run agentic workflows locally
- Agents leverage both LLMs (for creativity/context) and scripts (for enforcement/validation)
- Workflows are modular, versioned, and can depend on each other
- The process is always faster and more reliable than manual production
- **Workflows can be created for any SDLC phase, not just codegen**

## Chain of Actions (Workflow Transparency)
A key feature is to make the sequence of workflow steps and agent actions visible to users—similar to "chain-of-thought" in LLMs or how CI/CD pipelines visualize each stage. This chain of actions provides:
- **Transparency:** Users can see exactly what is happening at each step.
- **Debuggability:** If something fails, it's clear where and why.
- **Progress Tracking:** Users know what has been completed and what is pending.
- **Educational Value:** Users can learn how workflows are structured and how agents interact.

**Purpose:**
- Improve user trust and understanding of the automation process.
- Make troubleshooting and optimization easier.
- Enable richer UI/UX for workflow visualization in IDEs or dashboards.

**Implementation:**
- Log or visualize each step/action as it happens.
- Optionally, provide a graphical or textual pipeline view (like CI/CD dashboards).
- Allow users to drill down into each action for details or logs.

## Context Map/Castle (Context Management Idea)
A structured, queryable map of project context (like a mindmap or "brain castle") that allows agents and workflows to fetch only the relevant context needed for each step. This avoids bloating LLMs with unnecessary information, improves prompt relevance, and scales as projects grow.

**Purpose:**
- Prevent LLM context overload and token bloat
- Ensure only the most relevant context is injected into prompts
- Enable agents/workflows to dynamically request the context they need

**Potential Benefits:**
- Improves LLM output quality and reliability
- Makes context management scalable and composable
- Allows for visualization and editing of project context
- Enables automated context pruning and reuse

**Critical Considerations:**
- Must balance structure with flexibility (not too rigid, not too loose)
- Needs to be easy to maintain and update as projects evolve
- Should not introduce excessive complexity or maintenance burden

## Phased Learning & Improvement Strategy
To ensure agents and workflows continuously improve:
- **Phase 1: Self-Learning (Local, Private):**
  - Each agent/workflow logs its own successes, failures, and feedback locally.
  - Agents can self-tune and suggest improvements based on private logs.
  - Users have full control and transparency over their own learning data.
- **Phase 2: Opt-In Community Logging (Aggregated, Anonymized):**
  - As the user base grows, users can opt-in to share anonymized logs and feedback.
  - Aggregated data is analyzed to identify common issues and improvement opportunities.
  - Community-driven insights accelerate platform evolution while respecting privacy.
- **Phase 3: Evolved, Community-Driven Agents/Workflows:**
  - Improved versions of agents/workflows are released based on real-world data and feedback.
  - The feedback loop continues, with transparency and user control at every stage.

**Best Practices:**
- Always prioritize transparency, privacy, and actionable improvement.
- Make learning and logging pluggable and user-controllable.
- Communicate improvements and changelogs clearly to users.

## Target Audience
- Professional developers and teams seeking to automate and standardize the entire SDLC
- Open source contributors interested in sharing and improving agentic workflows
- Tool builders and workflow designers looking for a composable, extensible platform
