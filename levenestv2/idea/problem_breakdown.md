# Problem Breakdown: levenestv2

## Principle: Objective → Variables → Feedback Loop
1. **Objective:** Start with a clear, one-line statement of what you want to achieve.
2. **Variables:** Identify the unknowns or sub-problems (variables) that must be solved to achieve the objective. Each variable becomes a smaller, testable objective.
3. **Feedback Loop:** Test each variable in isolation, gather feedback, and iterate. Only integrate solutions that are validated. This loop ensures robust, reliable progress toward the main objective.

## 1. One-Line Objective
Build a local-first, IDE-integrated platform that serves as a foundation for automating the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC)—from requirements analysis to planning, code generation, validation, and beyond—using modular, composable workflows and agents.

---

## 2. Identify the Variables (Unknowns)
- **A. How to reliably extract and represent project context and requirements for all SDLC phases?**
- **B. How to design workflows that are modular, composable, versioned, and cover all SDLC phases?**
- **C. How to ensure outputs (code, plans, docs, tests, etc.) follow project standards and best practices?**
- **D. How to validate and enforce quality, correctness, and compliance in a developer-friendly way?**
- **E. How to enable real-time evolution, adaptation, and feedback throughout the SDLC?**
- **F. How to make the system fast, easy to adopt, and extensible for the community?**
- **G. How to manage context efficiently (Context Map/Castle) so agents and workflows get only the relevant information they need?**

## 3. Sub-Objectives for Each Variable

### A. Project Context & Requirements Extraction (SDLC-wide)
- Define what "context" and "requirements" mean for different SDLC phases (e.g., tech stack, user stories, sprint goals, test plans).
- Build/test extractors for context and requirements on sample projects.
- Validate: Does the extracted information match what a human would identify?

### B. Workflow Design (Modular, Composable, Versioned, SDLC-wide)
- Design a YAML schema for workflows and agents that supports all SDLC steps (requirements, planning, codegen, testing, deployment, etc.).
- Prototype workflows for multiple phases (e.g., requirements → planning → codegen → validation → deployment).
- Validate: Can workflows be composed, versioned, reused, and extended for new SDLC steps?

### C. Standards & Best Practices Enforcement
- Define rules/templates for each SDLC phase (coding, planning, documentation, testing, deployment, etc.).
- Test LLM prompts and script-based validators for adherence.
- Validate: Do outputs consistently follow the rules for each phase?

### D. Lightweight Validation & Enforcement
- Prototype pre/post hooks for validation (linting, static analysis, plan review, test coverage, deployment checks, etc.).
- Test in IDE and CLI environments for speed and usability.
- Validate: Is feedback fast, actionable, and non-intrusive?

### E. Real-Time Evolution & Feedback
- Design mechanisms for workflows to adapt based on feedback (e.g., sprint retros, code review outcomes, test failures).
- Prototype feedback loops that update context, plans, or code in real time.
- Validate: Can the system evolve and improve as the project progresses?

### F. Adoption & Extensibility
- Design a simple onboarding flow and documentation.
- Prototype a registry or sharing mechanism for workflows/agents.
- Validate: Can new users and contributors easily add, share, and use workflows for any SDLC phase?

### G. Context Map/Castle (Context Management)
- Design a structured, queryable map of project context that agents and workflows can use to fetch only the relevant information needed for each step.
- Prototype context retrieval and injection for different workflow steps.
- Validate: Does this approach prevent LLM context overload and improve output quality?

---

## 4. Testing & Validation Approach
- Each variable/sub-objective will be tested in isolation (unit tests, sample projects, user feedback).
- Only validated components will be integrated into the main platform.
- Continuous feedback and iteration will guide improvements.

---

## 5. Summary of Approach
We decompose the big problem into clear, testable sub-objectives. Each unknown is addressed as a mini-project, validated in isolation, and only then integrated. This ensures the final platform is robust, user-friendly, and capable of automating and improving every critical step of the software development lifecycle, with efficient context management and extensibility at its core.
