# levenestv2

A local-first, extensible platform for automating the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC) using modular, composable agentic workflows and tools.

## Directory Structure

- `packages/` — Agents, tools, and workflows (modular, versioned, composable)
- `context/` — Project context map/castle files
- `core/` — Orchestrator, registry, and core runtime
- `idea/` — Design docs, strategy, and living documentation

## Getting Started
1. See `idea/` for the vision, problem breakdown, and learning strategy.
2. Explore `packages/` for sample agents and workflows.
3. Run the orchestrator in `core/` to execute a workflow (see orchestrator.js for details).

## Next Steps
- Add new agents or workflows as packages.
- Expand the context map/castle for richer project context.
- Iterate and improve based on local learning logs.
