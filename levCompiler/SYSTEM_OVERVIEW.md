# levCompiler System Overview

## Complete AI Agent Orchestration Framework

levCompiler is now a comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework designed around AI agent capabilities and limitations, implementing intelligent routing, quality gates, and project context awareness.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Intelligent Routing Engine** (`/.control/routing/`)
- **4-Stage Analysis Pipeline**: Input Analysis → Workflow Matching → Agent Selection → Execution Planning
- **Multi-Intent Handling**: Decomposes complex requests into sequential or parallel workflows
- **Context-Aware Routing**: Uses project context to make intelligent routing decisions
- **Confidence Scoring**: Routes based on confidence thresholds (auto-route >0.90, suggest >0.70, manual <0.50)
- **Learning Adaptation**: Continuously improves routing accuracy based on success patterns

#### 2. **System-wide Quality Gate Management** (`/.control/gates/`)
- **3-Layer Quality Gates**: Universal → Workflow-Specific → Agent-Specific
- **Real-time Validation**: Validates quality gates as workflows progress
- **Escalation Management**: 4-level escalation paths for technical, business, and security issues
- **Contextual Adaptation**: Adapts quality thresholds based on project context and learning
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: Automatic, guided, and manual recovery strategies

#### 3. **Workflow Orchestration Engine** (`/.control/orchestration/`)
- **Multi-Modal Execution**: Sequential, parallel, conditional, and iterative execution modes
- **State Management**: Checkpoint-based persistence with rollback support
- **Agent Coordination**: Complete agent lifecycle management with handoff validation
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous event processing with pattern-based routing
- **Resource Management**: Dynamic allocation, load balancing, and adaptive scaling

#### 4. **Command Line Interface** (`/.control/interfaces/`)
- **Intuitive Commands**: `analyze`, `setup`, `generate`, `visual`, `context`, `monitor`, `config`
- **Context-Aware Help**: Project-aware suggestions and intelligent auto-completion
- **Multiple Output Formats**: JSON, YAML, table, and formatted reports
- **Real-time Progress**: Workflow progress bars with time estimates

## 🤖 Agent System (10 Specialized Agents)

4. **Dry-Run Testing Agent** (DRY-RUN-001) - Safe simulation and testing
5. **Gatekeeping Agent** (GATE-KEEP-001) - Final approval checkpoint
6. **Garbage Cleanup Agent** (GARBAGE-CLEAN-001) - Code optimization and debt reduction
7. **Visual Annotation Agent** (VISUAL-ANNOT-001) - Visual-to-functional mapping
8. **Version Tracking Agent** (VERSION-TRACK-001) - Git commits and version control
9. **Tech Stack Manager Agent** (TECH-STACK-001) - Project architecture and setup

### Meta Agents (Human-Supervised)

11. **Workflow Creation Agent** (WORKFLOW-CREATE-001) - Creates workflows with human supervision

## 🔄 Workflow System (5 Specialized Workflows)

### 1. **Project Analysis Workflow** (PROJECT-ANALYSIS-WF-001)
**For existing projects integration**
- 9 comprehensive analysis steps (2-3.5 hours total)
- Generates complete project context in `project_context/` directory
- Creates customized agent configurations
- Provides integration roadmap and improvement recommendations

### 2. **Project Setup Workflow** (PROJECT-SETUP-WF-001)
**For new project creation**
- Tech stack selection and project structure creation
- Best practices implementation and dependency setup
- Complete development environment configuration

### 3. **Code Generation Workflow** (CODE-GEN-WF-001)
**For code development**
- Requirements analysis → Implementation → Review → Testing → Optimization → Approval
- Industry best practices enforcement (SOLID, DRY, design patterns)
- Framework-specific implementations (React, Node.js, Python)

### 4. **Visual Development Workflow** (VISUAL-DEV-WF-001)
**For design-to-code transformation**
- Visual analysis → Implementation planning → Code generation → Validation → Refinement

### 5. **Base Input-Output Workflow** (BASE-IO-001)
**Core orchestration pattern**
- Universal workflow that routes all inputs to specialized workflows
- 5-phase execution: Input Reception → Analysis & Routing → Agent Orchestration → Quality Validation → Output Delivery
