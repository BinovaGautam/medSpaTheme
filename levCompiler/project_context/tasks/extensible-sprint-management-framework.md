#### **Extension Buffer (20% Capacity)**
- **Purpose**: Accommodate new requirements and enhancements
- **Characteristics**: Flexible scope, medium priority, value-driven
- **Management**: Dynamic allocation based on business value
- **Example**: T8.5 Typography Integration Enhancement (4 SP)

#### **Improvement Tasks (10% Capacity)**
- **Purpose**: Continuous process and quality improvement
- **Characteristics**: Ongoing, learning-focused, process-enhancing
- **Management**: Continuous execution with daily integration
- **Example**: T8.7 Performance Optimization (2 SP)

#### **Emergency Buffer (Reserved)**
- **Purpose**: Handle critical issues and blocking dependencies
- **Characteristics**: Crisis response, immediate priority, scope protection
- **Management**: Activated only for critical situations
- **Trigger**: Critical bugs, security issues, blocking dependencies

| Criteria | Weight | Critical | High | Medium | Low |
|----------|--------|----------|------|--------|-----|
| Business Value | 30% | >90% | 70-90% | 40-70% | <40% |
| Technical Complexity | 25% | <2 days | 2-5 days | 5-10 days | >10 days |

| Timeline Impact | 15% | None | <1 day | 1-3 days | >3 days |
| Risk Level | 10% | Low | Medium | High | Critical |

### **Capacity Management Rules**

#### **Extension Buffer Management**
- **Available Capacity**: Monitor real-time buffer utilization
- **Threshold Alerts**: 80% buffer utilization triggers rebalancing review
- **Overflow Protocol**: Extension tasks move to next sprint if buffer exceeded
- **Quality Protection**: No buffer task compromises core task quality

#### **Rebalancing Triggers**
- **Core Task Completion**: >80% core tasks completed enables buffer expansion
- **Velocity Changes**: Team velocity changes trigger capacity recalculation
- **Scope Creep**: >50% buffer utilization triggers stakeholder review
- **Quality Issues**: Quality gate failures trigger capacity protection mode
