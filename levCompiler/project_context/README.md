# Project Context Directory

This directory contains comprehensive project context information generated by the **Project Analysis Workflow** when integrating levCompiler with existing projects.

## Directory Structure

### `/profile/`
Contains high-level project metadata and characteristics:
- `project_metadata.json` - Basic project information, tech stack, team size, etc.
- `tech_stack_profile.json` - Detailed technology stack configuration
- `architecture_summary.json` - High-level architecture patterns and decisions
- `team_conventions.json` - Team-specific coding conventions and preferences

### `/analysis/`
Contains detailed technical analysis of the existing project:
- `structure_analysis.json` - Directory structure and file organization analysis
- `quality_metrics.json` - Code quality metrics and assessments
- `dependency_analysis.json` - Dependency mapping and vulnerability analysis
- `security_assessment.json` - Security posture and recommendations

### `/patterns/`
Contains identified patterns and conventions:
- `design_patterns.json` - Detected design patterns in the codebase
- `coding_conventions.json` - Identified coding style and conventions
- `architecture_patterns.json` - Architectural patterns and structures
- `naming_conventions.json` - Naming patterns and standards

### `/integration/`
Contains levCompiler integration configurations:
- `agent_customizations.json` - Project-specific agent configuration overrides
- `workflow_adaptations.json` - Workflow customizations for the project
- `quality_thresholds.json` - Project-specific quality gate thresholds
- `integration_settings.json` - Integration preferences and settings

### `/improvements/`
Contains improvement plans and recommendations:
- `technical_debt_plan.json` - Technical debt reduction roadmap
- `quality_improvement_plan.json` - Code quality enhancement plan
- `security_hardening_plan.json` - Security improvement recommendations
- `performance_optimization_plan.json` - Performance optimization opportunities

## Usage

### How Project Context is Generated
1. **Project Analysis Workflow** scans existing project
2. **Tech Stack Manager Agent** identifies technologies and patterns
3. **Code Reviewing Agent** analyzes quality and architecture
4. **Dry Run Testing Agent** analyzes testing infrastructure
5. Context files are generated based on analysis results

### How Agents Use Project Context
- **Code Generation Agent**: Uses patterns and conventions to generate consistent code
- **Code Reviewing Agent**: Uses quality thresholds and standards for reviews
- **Tech Stack Manager**: Respects existing tech stack constraints
- **All Agents**: Reference team conventions and project-specific configurations

### Integration Process
1. Run Project Analysis Workflow on existing project
2. Review generated context files for accuracy
3. Customize agent configurations if needed
4. Begin using levCompiler with project-aware agents

## Example Integration Command
```bash
# Analyze existing project
levCompiler analyze --project-path /path/to/existing/project --scope full

# Review generated context
levCompiler context review --project-context ./project_context

# Customize if needed
levCompiler context customize --agent code-generation --threshold 0.85

# Start using with project context
levCompiler generate --component UserProfile --context-aware
```

## Benefits
- **Consistency**: Agents respect existing project patterns
- **Quality**: Maintains project quality standards
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing workflows
- **Learning**: System understands project-specific requirements
- **Evolution**: Continuous improvement based on project feedback

## Maintenance
- Context should be updated when significant project changes occur
- Regular reviews ensure context accuracy
- Context can be version controlled alongside project code
- Backup context before major project modifications
